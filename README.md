# Word-Level-RNN-Joke-Generator
Inspired by a request for research from OpenAI, I developed a word-level recurrent neural network and generated jokes using Beam Search

## Generate Jokes
1. [Download the Model](https://www.dropbox.com/s/h2id25pjswkhs78/finalWeights?dl=0)
2. Place it in the Models Directory. Keep the name the same (finalWeights)
3. Run Beam Search 

Note: generating jokes may take a while!
