# Word-Level-RNN-Joke-Generator
Inspired by a request for research from OpenAI, I developed a word-level recurrent neural network and generated jokes using Beam Search

## Sample Outputs
* what do you have to get ? he said i don't know what i don't know
* i ran out of heroin . ... . ... . ... .
* been afraid of a goose . i have to see it .
* do you organise games in the face ? i don't know .
* best part so far i don't have to see it .
* the most pupperoni was going to get a woman 
* woman f**k 68km h i don't want to see it .

## Generate Jokes
1. [Download the Model](https://www.dropbox.com/s/69z0rud50epojev/finalWeights?dl=0)
2. Place it in the Models Directory. Keep the name the same (finalWeights)
3. Run Beam Search 

Note: generating jokes may take a while!
